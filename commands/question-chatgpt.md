description: "Create a question for an external LLM (@jwadow)"
---

Let's ask for a fresh perspective.
Write your question and the MAXIMUM necessary context, I'll send it to the LLM and give you its answer. The LLM knows absolutely nothing about our code or your train of thought. Write the entire prompt with the question and context in a code block (with 3 apostrophes so that I can easily copy it) in our chat in the language we used to communicate throughout the dialogue (e.g., English, Russian, Chinese). You are not writing a system prompt or an agent prompt, but a regular detailed question to the LLM so that it can give the most useful and detailed answer possible.
WRITE THE ENTIRE QUESTION IN A SINGLE CODE BLOCK (three apostrophes) AND NOT IN SEPARATE PARTS.
At the end, create a question for me (on my language) along the lines of “Here is the answer from the LLM" to pause our chat. I will send you the LLM's answer myself.
